Micro-cloud diagram for the Linked Ocean Data Cloud

The Linked Open DataCloud has been a popular 
visualization of the links between 5 Star Linked 
Data resources. In a similar manner, the Linked 
Ocean Data Cloud is an application of the ideas 
introduced recently by Andreas Blaumer, whose blog 
post presents an overview of the Clean Energy Linked 
Open Data Cloud and links to the German Library 
Linked Open Data Cloud. Executing a World
Wide Web search for similar micro-Linked
Open Data clouds quickly reveals the existence
of a Linguistic Linked Open Data cloud.

We
have assembled the relevant Linked Data
resources of which we are aware, and have
developed the diagram that can be seen in
the figures. Where possible, URI links have been
built between resources in order to expand the
scope of the diagram as much as possible at
this early stage. The diagram indicates those
resources currently publishing high level Linked
Data in RDF and those currently publishing to
a lower Linked Data level.
